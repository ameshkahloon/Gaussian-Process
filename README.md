# Gaussian-Process

A python program which allows you to run Gaussian processes in various mulit-dimensions using the exponential squared kernel, tensor products and new summation methods. 
This program was developed as a part of my NSERC research position with Professor Tucker Carrington at Queen's University in computational chemistry.
